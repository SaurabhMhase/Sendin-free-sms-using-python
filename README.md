## Introduction

Usually you have to pay for sending an SMS, no matter if you use your mobile or any application program. But if you are a programmer, and working on a project which involves sending SMS (maybe for notifying purpose) but you don’t want to spend money for it, then I have found a way for you.

## Idea

There are many organizations who offer free sms sending from their app or website. One of them is way2sms. Here this code on running, it will visit their page, login as you and send an SMS through their website. For the website, It will be like a human visiting the page, but actually it will be a bot, or simply this computer program.
